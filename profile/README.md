# trilliumOS

trilliumOS is an immutable Linux desktop operating system built for continuity.

It is designed to change slowly, deliberately, and with respect for the user’s time, habits, and trust. Like the plant, trilliumOS values balance over speed and longevity over novelty.

We believe an operating system should feel familiar year after year. Updates should strengthen the system, not reshape it. Progress should be quiet.
